# Adventure Path Fix - Quick Reference

## TL;DR

Adventure paths were going to the wrong collection and having NPCs extracted when they shouldn't.

**Time to Fix**: ~15-20 minutes

---

## Quick Fix Guide

### 1. Backup (2 min)
```bash
# Create Qdrant snapshot
curl -X POST "http://localhost:6333/collections/your_collection/snapshots"
```

### 2. Apply Fix (5 min)

**Option A**: Use the fixed files
```bash
cp qdrant_handler_fixed.py ./qdrant_handler.py
cp import_processor_fixed.py ./import_processor.py
```

**Option B**: Manual edits - See `FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### 3. Test (3 min)
```bash
# Test single file
python cli.py import --file "Test Adventure.md"

# Should see:
# ‚úì "Routing 'Test Adventure.md' to adventure paths collection"
# ‚úì "Skipping NPC extraction for adventure path"
```

### 4. Cleanup Misplaced Data (10 min)
```bash
# Preview what will be deleted
python cleanup_adventure_paths.py --dry-run

# Actually delete (after reviewing!)
python cleanup_adventure_paths.py --execute
```

### 5. Re-import (varies)
```bash
# Re-import your adventure paths
python cli.py import --directory "./adventures/"
```

---

## What Changed?

### Before (Buggy):
```python
# Only checked for exact phrases
if 'adventure path' in filename or 'adventurepath' in filename:
    # Route to adventure_paths
```

‚ùå Missed files like "D&D Adventure.md"  
‚ùå Extracted NPCs from all files

### After (Fixed):
```python
# Checks for "adventure" anywhere in filename
if 'adventure' in filename:
    # Route to adventure_paths
    # Skip NPC extraction
```

‚úÖ Catches all adventure file variations  
‚úÖ Skips NPC extraction for adventures

## Common Issues

### "Import still going to wrong collection"
‚Üí Check: Did you update `qdrant_handler.py`?  
‚Üí Check: Does filename contain "adventure"?  
‚Üí Run: `grep -n "is_adventure_path" qdrant_handler.py`

### "NPCs still being extracted"
‚Üí Check: Did you update `import_processor.py`?  
‚Üí Check: Look for "Skipping NPC extraction" in logs  
‚Üí Run: `grep -n "skipped_npc_extraction" import_processor.py`

### "Cleanup script finds nothing"
‚Üí Good! That means no misplaced data  
‚Üí Or: Check your collection names in `.env`

---

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Show what files would be deleted
python cleanup_adventure_paths.py --dry-run

# Actually delete misplaced data
python cleanup_adventure_paths.py --execute

# Import single adventure
python cli.py import --file "path/to/adventure.md"

# Import all adventures
python cli.py import --directory "./adventures/"

# Check Qdrant collections
curl http://localhost:6333/collections
```
