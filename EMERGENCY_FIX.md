# EMERGENCY FIX - Syntax Error in import_processor.py

## Your Error
```
SyntaxError: unexpected character after line continuation character
```

This means your `import_processor.py` file got corrupted during copy/paste.

---

## üö® IMMEDIATE FIX (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Replace the Corrupted File

1. **Download the clean file**: [import_processor.py](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/import_processor.py)

2. **Replace the corrupted file**:
   ```
   Navigate to: C:\Users\Josh\Desktop\github\md-to-qdrant-importer\
   Delete or rename: import_processor.py (the corrupted one)
   Copy: The downloaded import_processor.py to this location
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment

Since you're missing the activation script, run this:

1. **Download**: [emergency_setup.bat](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/emergency_setup.bat)

2. **Copy to your project folder**: 
   ```
   C:\Users\Josh\Desktop\github\md-to-qdrant-importer\
   ```

3. **Run it**:
   ```
   Right-click emergency_setup.bat ‚Üí Run as Administrator
   ```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Check Python installation
- ‚úÖ Create/recreate virtual environment
- ‚úÖ Install all dependencies
- ‚úÖ Leave you in an activated environment ready to use

### Step 3: Start the GUI

After the setup completes, simply type:
```
python gui.py
```

## üîç What Went Wrong?

When you copied the file, the line breaks (`\n`) got literally inserted into the code instead of being interpreted as new lines. This is a common issue when copying from certain text editors or browsers.

**The error line**:
```python
ut_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n            json.dump(output_data, f, indent=2)\n
```

**Should have been**:
```python
ut_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            json.dump(output_data, f, indent=2)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Alternative Manual Fix (if download doesn't work)

If you can't download the file, manually fix your `import_processor.py`:

1. Open: `C:\Users\Josh\Desktop\github\md-to-qdrant-importer\import_processor.py`

2. Look for lines with `\n` characters and actual line breaks

3. Replace them with proper line breaks

4. Or easier: **Delete the entire file and copy this clean version from the artifact**

---

## ‚úÖ Verification

After fixing, run this to test:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Josh\Desktop\github\md-to-qdrant-importer
python -m py_compile import_processor.py
```

If no error appears, the file is fixed! ‚úÖ

If you see errors, the file is still corrupted ‚ùå

- [ ] Replace corrupted file in your project

**Fix**: 
```powershell
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
