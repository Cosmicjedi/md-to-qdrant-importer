- Betray temporary allies for greater good
- Balance personal survival vs helping others

### Power and Corruption
The adventure explores how power corrupts in both criminal and Imperial organizations:
- Black Sun's ruthless efficiency
- Imperial officers' personal ambitions
- The cost of opposing either faction

### Survival
At its core, this is a story about surviving in a dangerous galaxy:
- Staying ahead of bounty hunters
- Navigating political intrigue
- Making difficult alliances

## Scaling Guidelines

**For Experienced Characters:**

- Allow players to earn extra through side jobs
